Introduction:
I am intending on moving to the Sunshine Coast for a new Job in August 2022. The area is very diverse and there are many different places where I could move.
The things that I would like in my new location:
- Close to coffee shops and resteraunts
- Ideally close to the Coast
- Close to work (in Coloundra)

I am intending on using postal code data and location data to group different locations on the Sunshine Coast to see which areas most fit with my lifestyle based on Nearby Amenities
